                <h3>My Process</h3>
                <p>The learning objective for this Process Project 1 in the course, IAT 339, was to create a style guide that allows someone to use it for their own design and understand how HTML and CSS worked. It was also for preparing for Project 2 of the course. Within my style guide, I chose to stick to a simple design with only one font and used animation on hover to tell users that this thing is interactable or can be clicked on. 
                I struggled with learning HTML and CSS in this project as I was not familiar with this programming language. Specifically, the part that included responsiveness was where I have struggled in. After watching videos and various lectures about HTML and CSS, I was able to solve how to turn 6 boxes in a line to 2 lines with 3 boxes and center them as well. This is a large part of website design, and I was satisfied with how quick I picked up on responsiveness in website designing and other simple skills such as understanding how columns and rows work in CSS. Additionally, it showed me how grids work in this case and using media queries for responsiveness. 
                On top of designing the style guide, I learned how to make a site responsive depending on the size of the window and device. While I believe my assignment could be improved, I was able to create a piece that remained simple and minimalistic to fit to requirements of the project. Furthermore, it improved my existing design and programming skills.
