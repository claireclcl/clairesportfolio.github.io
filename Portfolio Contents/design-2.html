                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to create the icon of an app that “that informs you when to take a shower” which indicates what the function of the app is. The restriction for this project is that it must be created in black and white. A challenge I have faced while creating the icon app was making it look like an app that someone can download on their phones and communicating the functionality of the app through the icon design. I approached the project by thinking of things that reminded me of time and shower and chose objects that I think it would best represent those words. In this case, I believed that a clock would represent the time and a bathtub representing a shower time. Even though a bathtub may not literally mean showering, the bathtub represents the place on where to take a shower and is related to showering. In this case, I wanted the bathtub and clock to be more noticeable. To finalize the project, bubbles were added to enhance the icon and the slightly gray background would make the clock and bathtub stand out more. Specifically for this project, I learned to create contrasts in black and white only as well. As a graphic designer, I must make sure my design would work in different filters and have the correct amount of depth so users can identify what the icon is immediately. Accessibility is one of the priorities in graphic design because it is important to not intentionally exclude people from understanding an icon.
